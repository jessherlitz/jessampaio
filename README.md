Hi! I'm Jess! :)

For the past year, I've been learning software development. I'm starting a bachelors degree in Computer Science this coming Fall.

On my spare time I'm either working out, watching people play video games online or exploring new restaurants in the city.

I'm currently based in Manhattan, NY.

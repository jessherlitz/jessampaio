hello, world. 👾

I'm Jess! For the past year, I've been learning SQL, Python, Django, Javascript, Typescript, Node, RESTful APIs, GraphQL, React, React Native, Go, Jest, Webpack, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, Git, Kubernetes and Docker.

I would like to learn Rust and C++ in the future after I've got a solid grasp on what I'm currently learning. Might take awhile.. 😆 but I'll get there!

On my spare time I'm either working out, watching people play video games online, exploring new restaurants in the city or studying Math.

I'm based in Manhattan, living with my husband and our baby cat Chucky. 🐈

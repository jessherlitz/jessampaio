Hi! I'm Jess! :3

For the past year, I've been learning SQL, Python, Django, Javascript, Typescript, Node, RESTful APIs, GraphQL, React, React Native, Go, Jest, Webpack, HTML, CSS, Git, Kubernetes and Docker.

I would like to learn Rust someday in the future after I've got a solid grasp on what I'm currently learning. Might take awhile though.. ðŸ˜† but I'll get there!

Before all this, I was a boring Tax Attorney in Brazil lol!

On my spare time I'm either working out, watching people play video games online, exploring new restaurants in the city or studying Math.

I've lived in SÃ£o Paulo, Rio, Chicago and I'm currently based in Manhattan, NY.

Hi, I'm Jess! :) 👾

For the past year, I've been learning SQL, Python, Django, Javascript, Typescript, Node, RESTful APIs, GraphQL, React, Jest, Webpack, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, Git, Kubernetes and Docker.

On my spare time I'm either working out, watching people play video games online, exploring new restaurants in the city or studying Math.

I'm based in Manhattan, living with my husband and our baby cat Chucky. 🐈

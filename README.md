Hi! I'm Jess! :)

For the past year, I've been learning SQL, Python, Django, Javascript, Typescript, Node, REST, GraphQL, React, React Native, Jest, HTML, CSS, Git, Kubernetes and Docker.

I've been playing around with Go and Rust out of curiosity on my down time as well :)

I'm starting my second degree in Computer Science this coming Fall!

On my spare time I'm either working out, watching people play video games online, exploring new restaurants in the city or studying Math.

I'm currently based in Manhattan, NY.

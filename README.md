Hi! I'm Jess! :3

For the past year, I've been learning SQL, Python, Django, Javascript, Typescript, Node, REST, GraphQL, React, React Native, Jest, HTML, CSS, Git, Kubernetes and Docker.

I've been dedicating some time to learn Data Structures and Algorithms, which I really enjoy.

On my spare time I'm either working out, watching people play video games online, exploring new restaurants in the city or studying Math.

I've been playing with Go and Rust out of curiosity on my down time as well :) 

I've lived in SÃ£o Paulo, Rio, Chicago and I'm currently based in Manhattan, NY.

Hi! I'm Jess! :3

For the past year, I've been learning SQL, Python, Django, Javascript, Typescript, Node, REST, GraphQL, React, React Native, Jest, HTML, CSS, Git, Kubernetes and Docker.

I've been playing with Go and Rust out of curiosity on my down time as well :) I've been really enjoying learning about Data Structures and Algorithms.

On my spare time I'm either working out, watching people play video games online, exploring new restaurants in the city or studying Math.

I've lived in SÃ£o Paulo, Rio, Chicago and I'm currently based in Manhattan, NY.
